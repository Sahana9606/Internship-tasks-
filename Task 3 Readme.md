Overview

This task focuses on using SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data from a relational database.
You will practice core SQL concepts such as filtering, joining, aggregations, subqueries, creating views, and optimizing performance using indexes.

The goal is to build confidence working with SQL for real-world data analysis scenarios.

Objective

Use SQL queries to extract, analyze, and summarize data from a database.

Tools Used

You may use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
Any database client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, SQLiteStudio) can be used to run the queries.

Deliverables

Your submission should include:

task3_solution.sql – A file containing all SQL queries used.

Screenshots – Output screenshots of each query in your SQL editor.

Dataset

You may use the provided Ecommerce_SQL_Database or any dataset of your choice.
The typical dataset structure includes tables such as:

customers

orders

order_items

products

These tables simulate a simple e-commerce environment suitable for analysis.

SQL Topics Covered

The task includes writing SQL queries that demonstrate:

1. Basic SQL Operations

SELECT

WHERE

ORDER BY

GROUP BY

2. Joins

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN (if supported by your database)

3. Subqueries

Filtering using nested queries

Comparing values against aggregates

4. Aggregate Functions

SUM

AVG

COUNT

MAX

MIN

5. Views

Creating reusable views for analysis (e.g., sales summary)

6. Index Optimization

Creating indexes to speed up queries

Understanding when indexes are beneficial
